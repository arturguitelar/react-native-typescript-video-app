# React Native video app

Based on the video _"React Native Course for Beginners in 2024 | Build a Full Stack React Native App"_ from **JavaScript Mastery** youtube channel.

## Some differences

- This project is create using earlier libs
- I created a "fake api" to use instead Appwritter, just to make things easier and more centralized. So create users or posts doens't really works. It's just fake local data. üòÖ
- Using typescript instead javascript.
- The videoplayer doesn't works with youtube raw urls but still there. I'll try to build other sollution in the future.
- Maybe I'll try to take advantage of Expo's flexibility to create a web version of this app. Maybe not. üòÇ

## Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
